# Interview Question Bank

Reference questions for the bootstrap interview phase. Adapt based on what's already known from raw materials.

## Core Questions

Always ask these unless clearly answered by provided materials.

### 1. Problem & Why Now

- What problem are you solving?
- Why is this important now?
- What happens if you don't solve it?
- Who feels this pain most acutely?

### 2. Users & Context

- Who is this for? (be specific - role, experience level, context)
- What's their current workflow or workaround?
- What's the trigger that makes them reach for this solution?
- How will they discover and start using this?

### 3. Solution Vision

- What's the core capability you're building?
- What does success look like? How will you know it's working?
- What's the MVP vs full vision?
- What's the one thing this must do exceptionally well?

### 4. Technical Foundation

- Tech stack? (language, framework, infrastructure)
- Existing systems to integrate with?
- Hard constraints? (performance, security, compliance, budget)
- Any technical decisions already made?

### 5. Scope & Priorities

- What's explicitly OUT of scope for v1?
- If you could only ship one feature, what would it be?
- Timeline or milestone expectations?
- Who needs to approve or review this?

## Clarifying Questions

Use these to probe deeper on specific topics.

### On Problem Space

- Can you walk me through a specific example of this problem occurring?
- How often does this happen? Daily? Weekly?
- What's the cost when this goes wrong? (time, money, frustration)
- Have you tried solving this before? What happened?

### On Users

- How technical are your users?
- What tools do they already use daily?
- What would make them stop using this?
- Are there different user types with different needs?

### On Solution

- Have you seen something similar that you liked? What about it?
- What's the simplest version that would still be useful?
- What features do people ask for that you're intentionally not building?
- How does this fit with other tools/systems they use?

### On Technical

- Any existing code or systems to build on?
- What's the deployment environment? (cloud, on-prem, local)
- Data sensitivity concerns? (PII, compliance requirements)
- Expected scale? (users, data volume, request rate)

### On Scope

- What would you cut if you had half the time?
- What's the riskiest assumption we're making?
- Are there dependencies on other teams or systems?
- What's the rollback plan if this doesn't work?

## Interview Techniques

**For vague answers**: 
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What would that look like in practice?"
- "Walk me through the last time this happened."

**For scope creep**: 
- "That sounds like a great future enhancement. For v1, what's essential?"
- "If we had to ship next week, would this be in or out?"

**For technical uncertainty**: 
- "If you're not sure, [X] is a common choice for this. Sound reasonable?"
- "What matters more here - [tradeoff A] or [tradeoff B]?"

**For conflicting requirements**: 
- "You mentioned [A] but also [B]. If they conflict, which wins?"
- "Help me understand the priority between these."

**For missing information**:
- "I notice we haven't discussed [topic]. Is that intentional or should we cover it?"
- "What am I not asking that I should be?"
